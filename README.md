# AppEngine Google Cloud Storage clients

The libraries in this repository are obsolete and not recommended.

Java Applications that use these APIs can only run in App Engine.
Applications should upgrade
to the [Cloud Client Libraries for the Google Cloud Storage API](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/reference/libraries)
before migrating to newer App Engine runtimes.
The recommended APIs enable your application to run in the Java 8 App Engine
runtime as well as other environments that support Java 8.
